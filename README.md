# A Simple Web Server

In this project, I was exploring the concept of web servers. Within it, I tried to use the facilitues provided natively by the languages I used. It is the typical 'from scratch' project that fosters better understanding of how the web works before I could delve deeper into the frameworks available for golang.

## Usage

Start the server on your terminal or commandline

	$git clone https://github.com/oduortoni/simple-server
